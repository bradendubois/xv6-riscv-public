# xv6-riscv-public

A showcase of the features and modifications made to [MIT](https://github.com/mit-pdos)'s [xv6-riscv operating system](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv).

## Feature Summary

- the lseek system call
- a number of processes system call
- increased file and filesystem size
- a multi-level feedback queue for process scheduling
- a system call to change process priority

## Project Specification

You may notice that this repository is just a README.

### Where's all the code?

The code to accomplish the [listed features and modifications](#feature-summary) are made in a *private* repository, which fetches from [MIT](https://github.com/mit-pdos)'s [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) repository.

### ...but why?

After completing a wonderful (and wonderfully dreaded) [Operating Systems course](https://catalogue.usask.ca/CMPT-332), I felt motivated and interested in continuing modifications to xv6. After a discussion with the instructor, I have opted to make this project private by default, and will whitelist access to the repository upon request. Exercises and assignments in operating system courses can only be so original, and a quick Google search of *xv6 ``<feature>``* already will yield [many public repositories of previous assignments](https://www.google.ca/search?q=xv6+github+solutions). A public repository showcasing the features implemented and changes made is available here, and access to the source code with these changes will be granted to potential supervisors, employers, etc. upon request.

### How can I see your code?

For the above reasons, the code with these modifications will be made available (by whitelisting access to a private GitHub repository of mine) to any interested supervisors, employers, etc. upon request. [Send me an email!](mailto:braden.dubois@usask.ca) 

#### Wait...

**Q**: You have a *public repository with nothing in it* as a means of showcasing features that are in a *private repository*, adding a barrier to entry. This seems like a whole lot of work, and it's all for the sake of academic integrity?

**A**:  You bet!
